# Decentralized lottery system
A blockchain based decentralized lottery system. The smart contract is deployed over Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network.

### Need for decentralization
- A centralized lottery system has a central authority.
- The central authority has the overall access to collect the amount and draw the winner.
- They can manipulate and can also be biased in picking winner.
- Also, centralized lottery will have a single point of failure.

### üìù About the project
- A decentralized lottery system disperses power.
- No authority has any control over the amount, the smart contract's address will hold the entire amount.
- The Winner will be picked by the deployer of the contract called as the manager.
- The Winner will be decided by the random function which is cryptographically hashed and is almost impossible to predict.
